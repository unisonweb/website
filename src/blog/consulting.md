We are spinning up a consulting group, now open to work _in a variety of languages_, **including Scala, Haskell, Rust, Elm,** and of course **Unison.** How this works is flexible: we can contribute alongside existing engineering teams as ICs, build custom end-to-end systems from scratch, or serve in an advisory or thought-partnership role. Additionally, we offer customized training programs on a variety of technologies and topics. In short: whatever your organization needs, so long as it’s within the purview of something we know well.

Our goal is a self-sustaining model in which a mix of consulting and product revenue funds development of Unison-based tech well into the distant future. While our investors have been amazing to work with, we don't want to be dependent on outside financing for Unison's continued health. We aim to be cash flow positive as a business in the next 12 months and could use your help in getting there.

So, if you've ever wanted to work with the people who created Unison, [Unison Share](https://share.unison-lang.org), and [Unison Cloud](https://unison.cloud), and also wrote the book [Functional Programming in Scala](https://bookshop.org/p/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition-michael-pilquist/e3b6935687828fcd?ean=9781617299582&next=t), now is the time! You can get in touch at [**hello@unison.cloud**](mailto:hello@unison.cloud) or directly [book a call to discuss possible projects](https://www.notion.so/unisonweb/todo.com).

Bios of our team are below, but briefly, this is a highly experienced group with deep expertise in functional programming, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure management, compilers, language design, and artificial intelligence.

We really look forward to hearing from you!
