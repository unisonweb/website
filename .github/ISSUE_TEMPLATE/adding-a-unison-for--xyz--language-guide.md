# Adding a Unison for <XYZ> language guide

See our [style guide for contributing a new language guide](https://github.com/unisonweb/website/blob/adds-language-contribution-style-guide/README/contributing-a-language-guide.md) for tips on style, content, html templating, and local testing. 

## Structure and subtasks

Feel free to add or subtract from this basic structure. Different language guides may call for different subsections or emphasis. For example, if the type system is very different from Unison's. 

- [ ] Variables
	- [ ] Basic types
- [ ] Functions
	- [ ] Function application
- [ ] Namespaces and imports
- [ ] Comments and Docs
- [ ] Type definitions

- [ ] Running programs
	- [ ] `main` functions
	- [ ] the REPL/watch expressions
