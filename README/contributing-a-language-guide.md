# ðŸ“š Contributing a "Unison for XYZ language" Guide

Weâ€™d love your help in growing a library of **language guides** for Unison newcomers from other programming languages. These docs are designed to help developers in other programming languages quickly get oriented in Unison by showing side-by-side examples.

These documents are not exhaustive language manuals â€” they focus on the **core syntax, types, idioms, and issues** a new Unison user is most likely to run into, given the conventions of the compared language.

They should focus primarily on the **syntax** of writing Unison, not the intricacies of Unison Share, the Unison `edit/update` workflow, etc.

## What languages are we hoping to see?

We're looking for guides for languages that represent a range of paradigms and ecosystems, such as:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Java
* Typescript
* C++

If it has a large community, a well-known syntax, and is not Unison, we want to see it!
We're hoping to start with languages that are different enough from Unison that folks have some hurdles to clear.

### How do I help?

If you would like to add a new language guide, check out the `language-guide` issue type in this repo and create a ticket.

If your language guide is in flight and you want to collaborate, chat with us in [#libraries](https://www.unison-lang.org/discord) in Discord.

If you have any questions, or want help developing the guides, feel free to reach out to us on the [Unison Discord](https://www.unison-lang.org/discord).

## Style and Structure Guidelines

### Organizing a guide:

- Where possible, use the **non-Unison languageâ€™s term** in section and subsection headings, for example:
    - `### Case Classes` (Scalaâ€™s analogous concept) - not `### Record Types`
    - This makes the doc easy to navigate for learners searching for familiar terminology.
- Feel free to riff on this basic structure:

```
* Variables
	* Basic types
* Functions
	* Function application
* Namespaces and imports
* Comments and Docs
* Type definitions
* Pattern matching or conditionals
* Running programs
	* `main` functions
	* the REPL/watch expressions
```

### Style Conventions

- Brevity is the soul of wit.
- Bold-face terms are used for the name of a **core concept** in each section, when the concept could be considered analogous across languages.
    - For example: **call-by-name** parameters (Scala) and **delayed computations** (Unison)
- Italicized terms are used simply for *emphasis*.

### Side-by-Side Layout

- Present examples in a **two-column** format:
    - **Left column:** Unison
    - **Right column:** Language XYZ
- Align equivalent code examples line-by-line as much as possible

### HTML template conventions

Your language guides should be located/named like this:

`src/compare-lang/unison-for-<language>-devs.md`

The file should start with this block:

```
---
layout: "compare-lang"
title: "Unison for Scala devs"
description: "Comparing structures and patterns between Unison and Scala"
---
```

Side-by-side examples can be made like this:

```
<div class="side-by-side">
	<div>

    Unison example here

    ```
    a + b
    ```

	</div>
	<div>

    Other language example here

    ```
    a + b
    ```

	</div
</div>
```

Documenting fenced codeblocks:

`````
<div class="side-by-side"><div>

{% raw %}

````unison
{{I am a doc which involves a fenced codeblock:

```
1 + 2
```

}}
````
{% endraw %}
</div>
`````

## Running the project locally

- Clone the website `git` repo: https://github.com/unisonweb/website Then inside the website repo,  follow the install instructions here: [https://github.com/unisonweb/website?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-for-running-locally-and-deployment](https://github.com/unisonweb/website?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-for-running-locally-and-deployment)
    - The Unison Share `clone` step may take a while. The `website` project is one of our oldest projects!
- Run `npm start` in your terminal.
- Your service will run at [`http://localhost:2345`](http://localhost:2345)
- The language guide page name will look like:[`http://localhost:2345/compare-lang/unison-for-scala-devs/`](http://localhost:2345/compare-lang/unison-for-scala-devs/)
